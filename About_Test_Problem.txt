About Data - 
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, 
rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. 
Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to different 
place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of 
travel, departure location, arrivallocation, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. 
Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility 
in a city.

######### Problem Statement - 
In this project, you are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to 
predict bike rental demand.

######
Data

You are provided with following files:

train.csv : Use this dataset to train the model. This file contains all the weather related 
            features as well as the target variable “count”. Train dataset is comprised of first 
            18 months.

test.csv : Use the trained model to predict the count of total rentals for each hour during the 
           next 6 months.
